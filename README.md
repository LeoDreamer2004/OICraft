# OICraft

A SpringBoot based web server, for end term assignment for PKU Java programming course in 2024 spring. See [the report](./report/report.md) for more details.

Run the `run.bat`(in Windows) or `run.sh`(in Linux) to start the server with essential local environments(include the api-key or password etc. Not public here for security reasons). Of course, you can also set the environment variables manually. See the variables in `application.properties` & `ai.properties`.
