A SpringBoot based web server, for end term assignment for PKU Java programming course in 2024 spring. See [the report](./report/report.md) for more details.

Run the `init.bat`(in Windows) or `init.sh`(in Linux) to set the local environment for API key, database password, etc, and then start the server(Not public here for security reasons). Of course, you can also set the environment variables manually. See the variables in `application.properties` & `ai.properties`.
